			<h1>Research</h1>
			<p>I'm now doing research under GEMS Lab led by Professor Danai Koutra. The unergoing project is a graph alignment problem. We aim to utilize locality sensitive hashing method to efficiently and effectively find potential matching pairs when given multiple large graphs. We've tested our method using synthetic datasets and combine with state-of-the art techniques to see how much we performance we gain by introducing our method.</p>
